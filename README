NAME

Gravatar::URL - Make URLs for Gravatars from an email address

SYNOPSIS

    use Gravatar::URL;

    my $gravatar_id  = gravatar_id($email);

    my $gravatar_url = gravatar_url(email => $email);

DESCRIPTION

A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar for a given email address. This
allows you to have a global picture associated with your email address.
You can look up the Gravatar for any email address by constructing a URL
to get the image from gravatar.com. This module does that.

Examples of use include the author faces on <http://search.cpan.org>.

See <http://gravatar.com> for more info.

THANKS

Thanks to gravatar.com for coming up with the whole idea and Ashley Pond V
from whose Template::Plugin::Gravatar I took most of the original code.
